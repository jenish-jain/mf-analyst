# mf-analyst

```
An application that helps you analyse your sip results
```

#### TODO list

- [x] fetches data from mf open source api 
- [x] plots it on graph
- [x] provide output in png
- [ ] take sip amount as input and plot its result on the same graph
- [ ] take sip amount and fund name / code as input 
- [ ] ui to select funds by searching name
- [ ] plot the graph on terminal
- [ ] plot the graph on webpage with tooltips and markers to interact with
- [ ] project fund and sip result to a possible range
- [ ] mark points on historical graph good for lumpsum investments
   >  This will help in providing entry points to make lumpsum adjustments 
       in the same fund with an ongoing SIP and helps user to park their
       excess income 
- [ ] detect lumpsump entry points in realtime series
    > something that displays good and bad time to make lumsump adjustment 
       on the ongoing results mostly concerned with the current time range 
       here where the investment will happen.
